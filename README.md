# Analyzing-American-President-s-Twitter-Diplomacy-And-Social-Network
The project, titled "Analyzing American Presidents' Twitter Diplomacy and Social Network," examines the intricate interplay between politics and digital communication on the Twitter platform. Through the application of Network Analytics, the study aims to uncover nuanced communication patterns and trends within the online strategies of former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. The primary objectives encompass comprehensive data analysis, spanning network analysis, sentiment analysis, and entity extraction, thereby yielding invaluable insights into the ever-evolving landscape of online discourse in the contemporary era.

The project employs a systematic methodology, commencing with data collection from Kaggle, concentrating on tweets authored by Presidents Obama and Trump both before and during their respective presidencies. Rigorous data preprocessing techniques are employed to ensure data quality and consistency, while entity extraction reveals critical elements such as hashtags, emojis, and mentions. Frequency analysis illuminates commonly used mentions and hashtags, while sentiment analysis, facilitated by the VADER module, classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Social Network Analysis, implemented through Gephi, offers visualizations of networks of Twitter users mentioned by the presidents, unveiling key insights into their online engagement strategies. Ultimately, the project aspires to provide substantial insights and conclusions concerning the distinctive features of the presidents' online diplomacy and underscores the transformative potential of data-driven decision-making in shaping public discourse. Acknowledging certain limitations, including constraints in entity scope and challenges in sentiment analysis and manual user identification, this project contributes to our comprehension of the intricate usage of twitter by the US Presidents over a decade . It sheds light on how US Presidents leverage social media, particularly Twitter, to engage with the public and influence opinions.
